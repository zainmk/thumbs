## intro
The purpose of this application is for users to track the movies/shows/games they've 'experienced' in a memorable manner. The goal is to make the experience interactable as well, including 'Easter Eggs' to unlock new features and a social system to easily add items to your watchlist. There can also be support for additional 'tools' based features and testing.

## to develop
The application uses [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) to render, therefore you will need Node/NPM installed. We use the [MaterialsUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) for components and styling.

Begin by installing the necessary dependencies...

     npm install

Then use the following command to run (w/ react-scripts)...

     npm start

You will need several keys saved in the appropriate '.env' file. Contact repo owner for these keys.


This app is currently in development, can expect instability and drastic changes in the meantime.
